## 📊 Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn based on their demographics, service usage, and account information. The Telco Customer Churn dataset from IBM is used for training and evaluation.

### 🧠 Problem Statement

The goal is to identify which customers are likely to stop using the company's services (i.e., churn), allowing the business to take action and retain them.

### 📁 Dataset

* **Source**: [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
* **Rows**: 7,043
* **Columns**: 21

### 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

### 📌 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Visualize churn, binary features, and monthly charges.
3. **Model Building** – Train a classifier (e.g., Random Forest) to predict churn.
4. **Evaluation** – Use accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
5. **Feature Importance** – Identify top factors influencing churn.

### ✅ Output

* Churn prediction accuracy
* Confusion matrix
* Feature importance chart
* Actual vs Predicted churn comparison
